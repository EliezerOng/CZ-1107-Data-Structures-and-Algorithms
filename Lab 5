Q1 Write a C program to convert an infix expression to a postfix expression. The input and the output of
the function are character strings. The input expression contains only four possible operators: +, -, *
and /. Operands can be any alphanumeric. Each operand is represented by a character symbol. The
parentheses are allowed in the input expression. You may assume that the expression is always valid.

void in2Post ( char * infix , char * postfix )

Q2 Write a C program to evaluate a postfix expression. You may assume that operands are single-digit
numbers. The function prototype is given below:

double exePostfix ( char * postfix )

Q3 Write a C program to convert an infix expression to a prefix expression.

void in2Pre ( char * infix , char * prefix )
