Q1 Given an array of n elements. Find two elements in the array such that their sum is equal to K. The two
elements can be the same element. Once a pair of elements is found, the program can be terminated.
The function prototype is given below:

void dualSearch (int A [] , int size , int K , int dualIndex [])

Q2 Given a sorted array of n elements. Find two elements in the array such that their sum is equal to K.
The two elements can be the same element. Once a pair of elements are found, the program can be
terminated.

void dualSearch (int A [] , int size , int K , int dualIndex [])

Q3 Implement a closed addressing hash table to perform insertion and key searching. The insertion may
not have to insert at the end of the link-list.

ListNode * HashSearch ( HashTable *, int) ;
int HashInsert ( HashTable * , int );
